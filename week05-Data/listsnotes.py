print (alist)

# alist [5]= 99

# len (list) - to get the length of a list

# alist [len (alist) -1] - this will give you the last element in the list
# alist [-1] - this will also give you the last element in the list
# alist [1:4] - to give the 2nd to 4th element
# alist [:4] - to give the 1st to 1st to 4th element
# alist [1:] this will give you the 2nd to the last element
# alist [::2] - if you want to get every 2nd element (jumps 2)
# alist [::-1] - the string in reverse

# x= alist.pop(0) - to remove the first element of the list and stores the first element as x 

# list.append ( ) - to add to a list
