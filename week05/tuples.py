# messing with tuples
# Author : Michelle O'Connor

atuple = (1,2,3)

print (len(atuple))

# tuple [0] will give you the first element
# however it will not allow you to change an element. Therefore tuple[0] = 99 will not work

# unpacking
# atuple = (1,2,3)
# x, y, z = atuple
# x = 1
# y = 2
# z = 3
