# Author : Michelle O'Connor

firstnumber = int(input('Enter first number:'))
secondnumber = int(input('Enter second number:'))
finalnumber = int(firstnumber - secondnumber)
anotheranswer = (firstnumber - secondnumber)

print("{} minus {} is {} " .format(firstnumber, secondnumber, finalnumber))




# Learning outcomes 
# print must start with a small letter
# if using ' or ", must use the same of the start and end and not a mix of both
# for the answer don't need to have int in the line
