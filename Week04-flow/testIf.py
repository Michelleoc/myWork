# Program to show the format of an if statement
# Author : Michelle O'Connor

if True:
    # statements
    print("condition is true")


if 2==2:
    print("yes the world is sane")


if 2 != 2:
    print ("I hope this is not displayed")
else:
    print ("2 is not equal to 2 is false")

a = 2
if a != 2:
    print ("I hope this is not displayed")
else:
    print ("2 is not equal to 2 is false")

b=3 
if b==2:
    print("b is equal to 2")
else:
    print ("b is not equal to 2")



# Learning outcome
# important to put ':' at the end of if True. This triggers the statement
