# This program prints out multiplication results
# Author : Michelle O'Connor


number = 111
newnumber = 555
print (int(number) * int(newnumber))

print (int(111) * int(555))

# learning outcome : for python to recognise 111 as a number, we must prefice it with "int"
# Showing 2 different ways to type it to get the same result
# use w3 schools for help
