# lambda is an annonymous function as it doesn't have a name

# no longer needed as using lamdba
# def triple (num):
    # return num * 3

isMax = True
# is Max = False then it will return the tripler value
if isMax: 
    fun = lambda num : Num *2 
else:
    fun = lambda num : Num *3

var = fun(10)

print (var)
